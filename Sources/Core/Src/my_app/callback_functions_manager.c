/**
 * @file callback_functions_manager.c
 * @author Nicol√°s Almaraz
 * @brief Manages interrupt callbacks and events for the entire application.
 *
 * This file handles callback functions for various interrupts and events across the entire application.
 * It centralizes the management of these interrupts and events and directs them to the appropriate
 * API-specific callback functions with custom names.
 *
 * The purpose of this file is to provide a single point of management for all application-wide
 * interrupts and events, ensuring that each API can handle them correctly without interference.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Define custom callback functions for each API and event.
 * - Implement the generic interrupt and event handling in this file.
 * - The appropriate API callback function is called based on the interrupt or event source.
